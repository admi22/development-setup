# Development Setup 

This file gives some pointers on how I assembled my development setup (03.02.2022). The whole setup is inspired by Scott Hanselman.

Installing WSL is pretty easy under Windows 11. I mainly followed this guide: [Windows 11 WSL + Terminal styles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT2L1SXFq9U&ab_channel=ScottHanselman)

## PowerShell

The Windows PowerShell is customized based on Hanselman's tutorial. See above link for the installation.

## Linux shell

For the Linux shell I use zsh with the oh-my-zsh extension and the PowerLevel10k theme. Installation is not too complicated - they have nice installation wizards.
Additional zsh-extensions:

## LF file manager
Allows to navigate folder structure inside shell.
